## Mock Data from Mockaroo
  For testing and development purposes, this project uses mock data generated with Mockaroo. Mockaroo allows us to create realistic, random data to simulate real user interaction.

  To generate similar data, you can visit the Mockaroo website and customize your data model to match the structure used in the project. Here's an example of the data schema used for generating tweets:
  
  -Tweet content (random text)
  -Username (random user names)
  -Date (random date)
  -Likes, Retweets, Replies (random numbers)
  -This mock data helps simulate a realistic environment for testing and development.
  
  Script Details:
  -The script fetches data from Mockaroo using the Mockaroo API.
  -The generated data includes random user information, tweets, likes, retweets, and replies.
  -The script formats the data to match the MongoDB schema and automatically inserts it into the database.
